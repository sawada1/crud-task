# crud-task

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Description

This project is a Trello-like task management application built using modern web technologies, including Vue.js, TypeScript, and Pinia for state management. The application enables users to manage tasks through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations across multiple columns, with a drag-and-drop interface for seamless task movement. 

The project leverages PrimeVue for UI components and Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern styling.

## Recommended IDE Setup
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
